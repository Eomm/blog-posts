# fastify-discord-app-demo

This repository is a growing tutorial to build an application with Fastify!
It will target Discord just for fun and to add some not-so-useful features.

Every upgrade will be documented and posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/eomm)
and here you will find the source code and the commit history!

To see the last version of the application, it is published at [https://fastify-discord-app-demo.herokuapp.com/](https://fastify-discord-app-demo.herokuapp.com/)
